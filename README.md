# bigdata-pav-project
bigdata-pav-project is a BigData academic project for the Computer Science Masters Degree which is offered at University Pablo de Olavide.

## Introduction
This is an academic project that contains different functionalities to determine the knowledge acquired about data processing, analysys and visualization.
Is the second part of the final project, the first one is the tool https://github.com/angelxwars/hbase-data-tools.git.

## Processing
This part is developed with Apache Spark in Scala. We process the data to get for every line the average measure of the next day.

## Analysis
In this part are using differents Machine Learning methods to get a prediction of the average measures. Is used Neural Network with R, Random Forest and Knn with MLib in Scala.

## Visualization
In this part is generating differents graphs for the previous parts to make a report where we interpret the results.
